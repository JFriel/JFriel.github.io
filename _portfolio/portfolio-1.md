A blockchain based messaging service that provides encrypted messages available publicly. Built upon the Etherium system, Methenger allows users of an etherium blockchain (public or private) to communicate in public without remvoving ant privacy. This is done by encrypting the message before it is added to the blockchain using an agreed protocol and keys. Methenger allows for private conversations to happen and be recorded with only the involved parties being privy to the discussion, allowing for real-time privacy and long-term accountability as anyone using that blockchain will have a copy of the encrypted message.
