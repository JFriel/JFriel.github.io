Easy Emoji is an Emacs plugin to insert utf-8 emojis into the current buffer using their Unicode Consortium description. Download the source HERE or get it from MELPA. Despite various programming languages supporting utf-8 characters, I would use you not to use it for variables as that way madness lies. I build this for Emacs chat clients, not ':) = 8;'
